Teachers are the backbone of student support when it comes to education, but they are the ones to provide reliability when it comes to understanding technology and how it functions so students can use it for in-class and out-of-class learning. Yet, what's hard to know is that a majority of teachers are not given proper technology training to acquire skills that can help their students out with technological questions or problems. 

This is why ICT (Information and Communication Technology) skills training comes in handy since this is how teachers are able to use these skills in their classrooms for engaging students with it. A teacher's usage of ICT skills in their classrooms relates strongly back to their individual training in these skills for teaching. It's shown that only receiving basic training on how to use ICT skills for teaching isn't sufficient enough in supporting students' learning in an era of digital learning. The driving factor in how teachers use ICT skills is how prepared they feel afterward from receiving training in the professional development of ICT skills for teaching. 

Investing in the need for high-quality professional development is seen as a high priority for many Latin American teachers than for teachers in other OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, pointing to the direction of reinforcing quality rather than quantity. A good quality training program that reaches a standard for teachers to be able to use ICT skills confidently in their classrooms for students leads to a successful outcome instead. This would definitely improve the fact that Latin American teachers' low performance in problem-solving within a tech-centered environment relates back to how their skills connect to student performance in class. Which, assisting teachers to strengthen their skills in ICT would increase student performance, which would then be a priority for Latin American governments to benefit from this positive outcome in their education systems.
