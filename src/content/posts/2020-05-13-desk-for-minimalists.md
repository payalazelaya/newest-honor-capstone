Rural and remote suburban areas are known to be the areas that do not get much importance when it comes to Internet access. These areas are also dead spots for how Internet signal is very weak based on how remote they're located on a map. At the same time, the amount of students who live in these areas that don't own a device is prominent and are not receiving the proper share of those who live in towns, cities, and even large cities who get their own devices.

The large focus point would be how allocating educational resources to all areas of a country is ensuring equity and fairness of educational opportunities for students and improving the performance of education systems. There has been a difference in how high-performing countries in Latin America have allocated more equitable resources to their education systems than semi-high-performing and low-performing countries. These two types of countries share more of their resources with advantaged schools than disadvantaged schools, bringing a negative outlook to the unfair distribution they're seen doing.

In this situation, establishing an equilibrium of providing resources to both advantaged and disadvantaged schools won't lead to rural and socio-economically disadvantaged schools being excluded from having access to ICT resources. Principals from these rural and socio-economically disadvantaged schools will be able to report less about receiving inadequate educational resources they're prominent in getting in the first place.

Examples of where this concept can fit appropriately are in countries like Costa Rica, Mexico, and Peru, which reported the tendency they have of allocating resources to advantaged schools, making disadvantaged ones hinder their students' learning because of a lack of or inadequate resources. While these countries can learn from the concept presented in the paragraph above, they can also adapt to other OECD (Organization For Economic Cooperation and Development) countries like Finland with the process of how to allocate resources. Finland's school principals report that the country has been prominent in allocating resources to schools regardless of their socio-economic status, thus both advantaged and disadvantaged schools receive resources, beneficial to students' learning. 

Overall, policy actions from governments that promote accelerating the digital transformation movement should also ensure that social inclusion is guaranteed to be of high priority. This inclusion should consist of, of course, equitable allocation of resources within schools, but also understanding the lifestyle of each student and how they're able to acquire resources, depending on where they live, whether it's a village, town, or city. At the same time, language variations consist throughout the entirety of the region where Spanish and native indigenous languages are well-known, taking into account how education reforms consider who gets included in programs that are addressed in these reforms too.
