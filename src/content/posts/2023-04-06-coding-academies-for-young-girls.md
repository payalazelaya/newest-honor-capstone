The creation of coding boot camps in Latin America has gained the participation of young girls from institutions to participate and learn what computer science and coding have to offer them. This influence of coding boot camps coming to Latin America comes from the rising popularity the U.S. has with these programs offered from as early as elementary or middle school for young girls all the way up to colleges/universities for young women. Essentially, what these coding boot camps are providing to the Latin America region is the closure of the region's technical skills and gender gaps.

For example, in Lima, Peru, a coding boot camp was filled with many female students who were very engaged in working on coding projects. At the same time, these girls were sharing remarks about their future in wanting to be a "full-stack developer" working with different technology, becoming a UX designer, being able to learn English, and wanting to have the potential to work at Facebook or Google as example companies they mentioned. 

You might be asking, who even is organizing these kinds of boot camps or academies? Laboratoria, a non-profit Latin American organization, is the one to be in charge of these events, where they target girls from low-income families facing major barriers to let them access higher education for themselves. Laboratoria's purpose essentially is that they emphasize the manner in which girls can build their first websites, apps, and games to continuously develop their skills so that their next step would be to go out into the workforce with their acquired skills in the organization that employers focus on, emerging with confidence in the ability they can settle in confidentially at technological jobs. 

Laboratoria's funding is primarily combined from external donors with contributions from graduates of the organization. Companies who hired graduates of Laboratoria are also paying the organization for their member's devoted membership while being in the organization as gratitude for it. As a result of having graduated from Laboratoria, graduates earn triple the amount of their income that stemmed from within their families, acknowledging that the majority of these young women have jobs as developers. 

Raising the expectation of girls to be engaged in technological fields is seen to be a priority in bootcamps that involve promoting the innovation of technology and the advocacy of attaining technological skills for the gender group. Essentially, bootcamps are supposed to be a positive development that should be carefully taken care of as they're a valuable opportunity that brings young girls together to close the present skills gap and raise awareness for career paths in the STEM field.
